<font face="pp"color="#4b0082" size="5"><b>In computer engineering<b></font>, 
computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization,
<br/> and implementation of computer systems.
<br/> Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.
 In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design,
 microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.<br/><br/>

The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace,<br/>
 describing the analytical engine. When building the computer Z1 in 1936,<br/>
 Konrad Zuse described in two patent applications for his future projects that
 machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data,<br/>
 i.e., the stored-program concept.<font face="pr" color="#7cfc00" size="5" > <b>Two other early and important examples are:<b></font><br/><br/></p>

The term “architecture” in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R.<br/>
 Johnson and Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959.<br/>
 Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication 
about the Stretch, an IBM-developed supercomputer for Los Alamos National Laboratory (at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory).<br/>
 To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types,<br/>
 hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of “system architecture”, a term that seemed more useful than “machine organization”.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, Brooks, a Stretch designer,
 opened Chapter 2 of a book called Planning a Computer System: Project Stretch by stating, "Computer architecture,<br/>
 like other architecture, is the art of determining the needs of the user of a structure and
 then designing to meet those needs as effectively as possible within economic and technological constraints<br/><br/>
Brooks went on to help develop the IBM System/360 (now called the IBM zSeries) line of computers,<br/>
 in which “architecture” became a noun defining “what the user needs to know”.<br/>
 Later, computer users came to use the term in many less explicit ways.<br/><br/>
The earliest computer architectures were designed on paper and then directly built into the final hardware form.Later,
 computer architecture prototypes were physically built in the form
 of a transistor–transistor logic (TTL) computer—such as the prototypes of the 6800 and the PA-RISC—tested,
 and tweaked, before committing to the final hardware form.<br/>
 As of the 1990s, new computer architectures are typically "built", tested, and tweaked—inside some other computer architecture in a computer architecture simulator;
 or inside a FPGA as a soft microprocessor; or both—before committing to the final hardware form.<br/><br/>
